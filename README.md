List at least three things you would do to improve the quality of the codebase in order of importance:
1. Use a redux store.
2. Using a router/controller to handle routes for cleaner server logic
3. Separate database logic (e.g lookups, shorten) from server logic.


Changes Added:
1. Add input validation and output sanitization.
2. Have previously generated links appear when we enter the app.
3. Allow users to delete URLs.
